#bert-models.ipynb

The file bert-models.ipynb contains four models for which the Accuracy and Response Time was calculated:
1. Albert
2. Roberta
3. Bert
4. Distil Roberta

#Queries Processed
The files "albert.csv", "roberta.csv", "bert.csv" and "ditil_roberta.csv" contains the maximum Similarity Score and the Time Taken for 30 values of the Dataset.

#Results
From all the Queries Processed the average Similarity Score and the average Time Taken on the sample set was found out:

|Model	       |SoC Processed|Similarity Score|	Time Taken ( in sec)|
|--------------|-------------|----------------|--------- |
|Albert	       |30	         |92.16%	      |0.12|
|`Roberta`     |`30`	     |`98.69%`	      |`0.13`|
|Bert	       |30	         |80.60%	      |0.13|
|Distil Roberta|30	         |71.46%	      |0.07|

#Conculsion
From the Results it could be concluded that “Roberta” model was the best fit according to the Similarity Score and Time Taken.
